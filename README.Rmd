PaRe (**Pa**ckage **Re**viewer) is the successor of the DependencyReviewer package. PaRe reviews other packages during code review and has the following features:

1. What dependencies are used, and what functions are used of that dependency.
2. The quality of the code style using lintr.
3. Code complexity, using the *cyclomatic complexity* scores.
4. How internally defined functions interact with one another, and visualizing this in a diagram.
5. Fetching locations of defined functions in R-files.
6. Checking dependencies against user a defined white list.
7. Count lines of code for different languages by default: R, C++, SQL, and Java.
8. Make a standardized HTML-report exploring the before mentioned features.

## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>

You can install the development version of DependencyReviewer like so:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darwin-eu/PaRe")
```

## Make your report <a name="Make your report"></a>

PaRe generates a report with all the metrics about your dependencies and code complexity. Just run the following line inside the working directory of your package. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
PaRe::makeReport(pkgPath = "./", outputFile = "./Report.html")
```
